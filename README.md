# Vue Form
Small challenge project made with Vue and Vuex. The goal of this project was to create a form to register a new item for sale, depending on which option you choose different fields appear. 

## Installation and Usage:
* Clone the project into a directory
* Open the terminal and run npm install
* Run npm run dev to execute the project in dev server. (localhost:8080)
* For production build use npm run build

## To Do:
* ~~Refactor into smaller components instead of having everything in one thing.~~
* Try to implement Modal success message after form submit.
* ~~Fix the responsive design for certain sizes of screens and the card height.~~
* ~~Make the design better in some aspects~~
* ~~Add styles to some of the default inputs~~

## Ideas:
* Redesign into a step by step form instead of dynamic updating everything at once
